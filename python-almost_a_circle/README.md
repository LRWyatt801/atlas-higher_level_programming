# Almost a Circle

This directory is to help practice what I have learned so far about Python.  In addition I will learn about args and kargs

## Learning objectives

- What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
- How to serialize and deserialize a Class
- How to write and read a JSON file
- What is *args and how to use it
- What is **kwargs and how to use it
- How to handle named arguments in a function
