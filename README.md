# Higher Level Programming

This repository contains a collection of projects demonstrating my progression in higher-level programming, primarily using Python, with additional work in JavaScript and SQL. These projects were completed as part of the Atlas School curriculum, focusing on developing advanced programming skills and understanding complex concepts.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into directories, each representing a specific project of concept:
- `javascript-warm_up`
- `javascript-web_jquery`
- `javascript-web_scraping`
- `javascript_objects_scopes_closures`
- `python-almost_a_circle`
- `python-classes`
- `python-data_structures`
- `python-everything_is_object`
- `python-hello_world`
- `python-if_else_loops_functions`
- `python-import_modules`
- `python-inheritance`
- `python-input_output`
- `python-more_classes`
- `python-object_relational_mapping`
- `python-test_driven_development`
- `SQL-introduction`
- `SQL-more_queries`


Each directory contains exercises, scripts, and projects that focus on specific programmin concepts and skills.

## Technologies Used
- __Languages:__ Python, JavaScript, SQL
- __Tools & Frameworks:__ MySQL, jQuery
- __Development Evironment:__ Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Getting Started

To explore and run the projects:

#### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LRWyatt801/atlas-higher_level_programming.git
```
#### 2. Navigate to a project directory:
```bash
cd atlas-higher_level_programming/python-hello_world
```
#### 3. Run the scripts:
```bash
python3 script_name.py
```

__Note:__ Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed for each project.  Some projects (like those using SQL or JavaScript) may require additional setup.

## Learning Objectives

The projects in this repository cover a wide range of topics, including:
- Python syntax and semantics
- Control structures and functions
- Data structures: lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries
- Object-oriented programming
- Error handling and exceptions
- File input/output operations
- Test-driven development
- SQL queries and database management
- JavaScript fundamentals and DOM manipulation
- Web scraping techniques

Hi, I'm Logan Wyatt â€” a former Operational Specialist with over 5 years of experience in real-world problem solving, now building a career in software engineering.

I specialize in system-level development with C, low-level Linux programming, and designing advanced algorithms. My background helps me bridge the gap between deep technical understanding and practical usability.

This repository is part of my work at Atlas School, where Iâ€™ve explored a wide range of higher-level programming concepts through hands-on projects in Python, JavaScript, and SQL. It showcases my growth in areas like:

- Object-oriented programming
- Data structures and algorithms
- Test-driven development
- File I/O and exception handling
- Web scraping and frontend scripting
- Relational databases and query design

Some of my other projects include:

- ðŸ”§ **Linux internals and process management** in my custom [Linux system repo](https://github.com/LRWyatt801/atlas-system_linux)
- ðŸŽ® A retro-style C++ game called [MEGAdrive](https://github.com/DaveyCHaysIII/Megadrive) focused on building logic and rendering systems from scratch
- ðŸ§  And additional work in algorithms, system design, and C programming on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/LRWyatt801)

I build projects like these from the ground up to truly understand how things work under the hood â€” and because I love the challenge. I'm fueled by curiosity (and Dr. Pepper), and I'm always eager to keep learning and growing as a developer.

If you're into clean, efficient, and meaningful code â€” let's connect!
